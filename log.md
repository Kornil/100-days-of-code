# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished back end for pinterest clone, still working on front-end.

**Thoughts:** I could not make masonryJS work, but I can make it without!

**Link to work:** [Pinterest Clone](https://github.com/Kornil/pinterest-clone)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Progress on front-end of Pinterest clone, now accept only valid input in form.

**Thoughts:** 5 min MDN > 2 hours stackoverflow, problem solving is better than bug fixing.
